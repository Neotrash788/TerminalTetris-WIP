# TerminalTetris-WIP
Logger module does not exist, it is something I made myself to help with debugging. If you want to run the code consider deleting the 'import logger statement' and any references to the file. These will be removed later.

Cannot be run in standard python terminal, it will have a tantrum due to the colours.
